		Integrating animation with video compositing is about a love story. Tinder is the most direct and concise expression. It met his favorite person but was captured by a UFO on the way, he tried to escape, and later met her, pursued her, and finally got together and had a small child.
        In order to reflect the simple and beautiful love, I created the seemingly simple image of the matchmaker. He
        had all kinds of difficulties in the pursuit of love, but he overcame and reaped the love. I want to give people
        inspiration through this, the most simple creature through their most simple way to pursue love. Not like the
        current attitude and thoughts of people towards love, people should not be philandering and playing with their
        feelings.

	   The story ends very well for the matchmaker because he explores the true meaning of love, it is pure and beautiful, and he gets and cherishes his love.

        The product introduced is a sports drink containing vitamins. The story is about a basketball player who was in
        standard form and missed his shots, and eventually drank the drink and then regained his regular shooting form
        he always makes a basket.
        The style of this project will have a bright and happy tone. As the story unfolds, the pace will create a sunny
        and positive experience for the viewer. The images are gentle and as shown in the video, playing basketball is a
        healthy way of life. The boys are playing basketball and are hot and passionate about it. The background music
        has a festive feel to it.

        Minimalism and flat design can be seen in any field of design such as painting, architectural design, decorative design, graphic design, etc. This style can be used anywhere and provides a clean, easy-to-read presentation. The calm, quiet, soothing and introspective pursued by minimalism can give people a very strong sense of comfort in productive life. The most distinctive feature of minimalism is its simplicity, which is in line with the modern concept of green and healthy living and has the quality of returning to the basics. My own life is a minimalist lifestyle people.

		These three animation projects were school assignments that I completed while at SAIT. Creating animation requires a certain amount of imagination to plan the story as well as the placement of the text and this practice allowed me to gain more experience as an animator, graphic designer.  It was a really fun project because I had never created animation before, so I was excited to step out of my comfort zone and expand my skill set, which was an interesting challenge.

		The starting drafts were all drawn with my own bare hands, and after the sketches were completed, I did the layouts on Adobe Animate. Once the outline was complete, I began to visualize how each frame would develop so that they would articulate smoothly, and finally, the selection of the musical background. I'm grateful that this task allowed me to further hone a variety of different skills.
